<h1>The Best Movies According To Samridhi</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>Jab We Met</h3>
<p>I love the character 'Geet'. She is so me.</p>
<h3>My Name Is Khan</h3>
<p>Good storyline and I love Shahrukh and Kajol together. It's a KJOs movie which is not a KJOs movie.</p>
<h3>Bulbul</h3>
<p>Bow down to dark feminine energy</p>
